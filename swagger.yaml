  description: "Used to get details about codes and code lists stored by ONS.
  Codes are used to provide a common definition when presenting statistics
  with related categories. Codes are gathered in code lists, which may change over time
  to include new or different codes. The meaning of a code should not change over
  time, but new codes may be created where new meaning is required."
